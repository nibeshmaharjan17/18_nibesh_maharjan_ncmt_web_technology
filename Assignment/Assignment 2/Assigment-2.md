##  CHAPTER 2: WEBSITE DEVELOPMENT PROCESS

## Group A:

### 1. Define the term ”Sitemap” in the planning phase.
**Answer: A sitemap is like a map that shows how a website is built. It shows how the pages connect, like how the About Us page links to the Our Team page. The main aim is to make sure the site is easy to use, so people can find what they need quickly. Think of it as the blueprint before you build a house.**


### 2. What is the purpose of the ”Launch” phase in web development?
**Answer: The launch phase is when we finally move the website from our computers (where only we can see it) to a real web server, so everyone can access it. It's not as simple as just clicking a button, though. We have to set up the servers, get the domain names working, and double-check that everything on the live site works just like it did when we were testing it.**


### 3. Why is ”Documentation” important in the development lifecycle?
**Answer: Documentation is important in the development lifecycle because different developers might need to update the site or fix bugs, without clear documentation explaining how the code works or how the database is structured, making changes becomes slow and expensive.**

### 4. Differentiate between Front-end and Back-end development.
**Answer: The difference between Front-end and Back-end development is:
. Front-end development is the client side of the web. It involves everything the user sees and interacts with colors, fonts, buttons, and layouts. It uses HTML, CSS , and JS.
. Back-end development is the server side. It includes things like the database, server logic, and how different apps work together. It makes sure that when you click buy, your payment goes through and the info is saved correctly.**


## Group B: 

### 5. ”Planning is the most critical phase of web development.” Discuss this statement by listing the key activities performed during the planning phase.
**Answer: Planning is the base because errors at this stage get bigger later on. Bad planning results in the wrong website. Here are the key things to do:
. Set Goals: Decide what the site should do, like sales, give info, or be a social place.
. Make a Sitemap: Plan the page structure.
. Pick Tech: Choose the right coding languages and tools (like WordPress, React, or Python).
. Assign Resources: Work out the budget, timeline, and team needed.**


### 6. Explain the iterative nature of the Maintenance phase. Why is a website never truly ”finished”?
**Answer: The Maintenance phase is a continuous loop rather than a final destination. In the software development lifecycle, a website is never truly "finished" because it exists in a dynamic environment that requires constant adaptation.
<br>
A website is never truly finished because of the following reasons: 
. Security Evolution: Cyber threats are constantly evolving. The maintenance phase involves an iterative cycle of scanning for new vulnerabilities and applying patches to keep user data secure.
. Content & SEO Freshness: To remain relevant to both users and search engines, content (news, prices, media) must be updated. This keeps the site from becoming an "archive" and ensures it remains a functional business tool.
. Performance & Scalability: As a website's user base grows, the original infrastructure may struggle. Maintenance involves monitoring performance and iteratively optimizing code or database queries to handle increased traffic.
. Adaptive Maintenance: Technology moves fast. Browsers (like Chrome or Firefox) and mobile devices release updates regularly. The site must be iteratively tested and adjusted to ensure compatibility with new hardware and software standards.
. User Feedback & Enhancements: Once a site is live, real user data reveals how people actually use it. This feedback triggers new mini-development cycles to improve the   User Experience (UX) and add requested features**


### 7. Describe the process of ”Information Gathering.” Why is understanding the target audience crucial during this step?
**Answer:**


## Group C: Scenario-Based Questions (5 Marks)

### 8. You are the project manager for a new e-commerce site. The client wants to skip the ”Testing” phase to save money and launch early. Write a persuasive argument explaining the potential risks (security, functionality, compatibility) of skipping this phase.
**Answer:**


### 9. A developer begins coding a website immediately after meeting the client, without creating a design prototype or sitemap. Midway through, the client rejects the layout. Analyze what went wrong in the process and how it should have been handled.
**Answer:**


### 10. A university website was launched successfully, but after six months, students stopped visiting it because the exam schedules were outdated. Which phase of the development lifecycle was neglected? Explain the activities involved in this phase.
**Answer:**
